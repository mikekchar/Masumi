	<h1>Releases</h1>
	<p>
	  Development on Masumi is organized by "stories".  The
	  stories are listed in the TODO document in the
	  main development tree of Masumi.  A story is a minimal
	  set of user functionality.  It should take no more than
	  8 hours of work to implement a story.  At the end of
	  the story, the code is meant to be releasable.  This means
	  that it contains all the functionality that is necessary
	  for a user to what the stories entailed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Even though Masumi is releasable after every story, we
	  may not want to make a public release.  It might not be
	  internally consistent from a user's point of view.  For
	  instance, we may have implemented a "Save" function, but
	  no "Load" function.  Because of this, we have a concept of
	  "public releases".  A public release is a release containing
	  a set of stories that is internally consistent.  We want to
	  make public releases as often and as early as possible.  This
	  allows ordinary users to contribute to the development process.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Even though every public release is internally consistent,
	  it may not contain enough valuable features to really merit
	  upgrading.  When we have made enough releases that we
	  want to recommend that the user upgrade, we will make a
	  "major release".  A major release is complete, consistent
	  and contains signigicant user value.  We should try to
	  time major releases to the user's expectations.  They may
	  not want to upgrade too frequently.  But on the other hand,
	  we want to get valuable improvements into the user's hands
	  as quickly as possible.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In addition to "public releases" and "major releases", we
	  may have to release a "patch release".  This happens when
	  a major release has a significant problem that must be fixed.
	  We may not want to create a new major release based on
	  the last public release since it may contain functionality
	  that we don't want to have in a major release yet.  Instead
	  we will make a "patch" release based on the last major release.
	  Public releases will not have patch releases, but we will
	  fix the problem and create a new public release as soon as
	  possible.  We will try to avoid making patch releases.
	</p>
	<h1>Understanding Version Numbers</h1>
	<p>
	  Masumi version numbers are of the form X.Y.Z.  X is the
	  number of the last major release.  Y is the number of the
	  last public release for that major release.  Z is the number
	  of the last patch release.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For example, 1.2.0 means the first major release and
	  the second public release.  1.0.0 is the first major release.
	  3.0.2 is the second pactch release of the 3rd major release.
	  There will never be a release like 1.2.3 because patch releases
	  only happen for major releases.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The very first version number should be 0.1.0.  To make
	  new public release, tag the source code in git with the
	  current version number.  Then increment the second digit
	  and check it in.  This means that all stories for the next
	  public release will contain that version number.  But it
	  is not a public build until it is tagged in git.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To make a new major release, increment the first digit and
	  set the next digits to 0.  Check the change into git
	  and tag it with the new version number.  Then increment
	  the second digit as before.
	</p>
	<p>
	  To make a new patch release, make a branch in git of
	  the last tagged patch release.  If there is no patch release
	  for this major version, branch the major version.  Make
	  the required changes, increment the third digit of the
	  version number and check it into git.  Finally tag the
	  branch with the resultant version number.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Sometimes you need to make a private release based on
	  the current source code.  In this case, please leave the
	  version number as it is, but rename the resultant package
	  to make it obvious that it is a private release.  If
	  you plan to make several, you should use a keyword associated
	  with the build machine and then use the build.num file
	  to indicate what build it is.  I will write more details
	  here when I implement automatic nightly builds.
	</p>
	<h1>Digitally Signing Releases</h1>
	<p>
	  On some platforms (Android for instance) the released
	  packages must be digitally signed.  To make matters
	  more complicated, you may not be able to upgrade
	  smoothly between two packages signed by different people.
	  This being the case, there will be a private signing
	  key available to members of the team that are resposnsible
	  for making builds.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is very, very important that this key does not get revealed
	  to anyone except certain members of the team.  If it does,
	  then anyone can sign our releases and possibly put
	  viruses in, etc.  Thus the key will only be available
	  to people who directly make builds.  Please don't be
	  offended if you request the key and are denied.  It is
	  only necessary for signing official releases.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I will write more information here as I develop the
	  code for making the Android builds.  I have been thinking
	  about it and the more I do, the more I want to sign
	  other builds as well (and possibly even the source code).
	  But I need more time to think about it.
