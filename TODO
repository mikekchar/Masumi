Masumi TODO List

* Stories
  Here is the pending functionality for Masumi.  This is the order I
  intend to takle the work.  If you would like anything done sooner,
  please contact me.  Once I've started work on one story, I won't
  change stories until it is done, though.

** TODO Create packaging for OSX [4/5]
   - [X] Do this:
		 http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/JavaLP/JavaToMac3/
   - [X] Create a Jar bundler Ant task
   - [X] Create a Zip task
   - [X] Create a minimal web page that shows how to install Masumi.
   - [ ] This will not install on OS X for some reason.

** TODO Create packaging for Android [0/3]
   - [ ] Create a package that can be downloaded and installed on
		 Android.
   - [ ] Create a signing key for the project and sign the release
         build as part of the build process.  Create a release management
		 process.
   - [ ] Create a minimal web page that installs Masumi.

** TODO Create packaging for WebStart [0/2]
   Webstart is a way to distribute applications for any Java platform
   using the web.  The person simply clicks a link on a web page and
   the application is installed.
   - [ ] Create a webstart application
   - [ ] Create a minimal web page that installs Masumi.

** After this point all functionality must work on Linux, Window, MacOS
   and Android before it is set to "done".  I wonder if that means I have
   to buy a Mac... Sigh...


* Completed Stories for Version 0.1.0
  As stories are completed, they will be moved to this section.  When
  there is enough functionality to merit a release, then a release
  will be built.

** DONE Create packaging for Windows [5/5]
   - [X] Wrap the Java jar file as a Windows executable and give it
     an icon.
   - [X] Make Masumi run from the start menu.
   - [X] Make Masumi run from an icon on the desktop.
   - [X] Create a uninstaller for Masumi.
   - [X] Create a minimal web page that shows how to install Masumi.

** DONE Create packaging for Debian/Ubuntu [4/4]
   - [X] Set a version number on each build.
   - [X] Make a debian package that contains the jar file
		 and a script that runs the jar file.
   - [X] Make Masumi run from the start menu with an icon.
   - [X] Create a minimal web page that shows how to install Masumi.
** DONE Find a better icon for Masumi [3/3]
   Masumi currently uses the icon from JLDrill.  We need a better icon.
   Update: I have done it.  It is still ugly, but it is at least distinct.
   - [X] Masumi is intended to be an assistant to help in the
     immersion of Japanese.  Masumi is also a girl's name.  So it
     might make sense to try to find a chibi anime girl graphic and
     use it as an icon.  The blender file shown on the following
     website might be a good place to start.  Licensing has to be
     sorted out, though.

	 Note: blenderartists.org seems to be down as of this writing.  I
     have placed the blender file in the main directory.  It is said
     to be Creative Commons licensed, but I don't know the details.
   - [X] Contact author
   - [X] Create copyright and acknowledgements page

** DONE Create an Android version [5/5]
   - [X] Install Android SDK
   - [X] Create version that starts on Android.  It should open
		 a window with nothing on it.  The user should be able
		 to navigate away from the window.  Android should be able
		 to suspend or close the app any time it wants.  There is
		 no exit option.
   - [X] Create Ant build process.
   - [X] Create tests that can be run on Android including from Ant.
   - [X] Document SDK installation instructions.
