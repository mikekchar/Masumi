This directory contains build tools.

Right now there are two build tools necessary for Windows packaging, 
launch4j and nsis-ant.  If you wish to build the windows executable 
you will need to download the appropriate files.  If you don't need
to make Windows packages, then you don't need to do anything here.

Lauch4j
-------
You can download lauch4j from here
http://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/files/launch4j-3/3.0.2/

Please extract the launch4j directory here.  This will allow
the ant script to build the Windows executable.

nsis
----
Please install nsis on your system.  On debian you can install it using
apt-get nsis.  Or you can download it from:

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

Then download the nsis-ant jar file into this directory
