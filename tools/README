This directory contains build tools.

Right now there is only one build tool, launch4j.  If you wish
to build the windows executable you will need to download the
appropriate file from here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/launch4j/files/launch4j-3/3.0.2/

Please extract the launch4j directory here.  This will allow
the ant script to build the Windows executable.
