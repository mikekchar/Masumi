In order to develop masumi-android you will need to install
the Android SDK.  Instructions for doing this are here:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html

I recommend installing the SDK in the tools directory of the
main Masumi distribution, but it should work anywhere.

After the SDK, you will also need to update the project
so that all the scripts know where to find the SDK.  You
do this by typing the following from the masumi-android
directory:

android update project --name masumi-android --target 3 --path .

The android executable is in the tools directory of the SDK.

You can build using the Eclipse plugin, or you can build using
the ant script. 

ant debug

will build the debug release.  In order to run it, you need to have an
emulator running.  Running "android" with no options will give you a list
of possible emulators.  Once the emulator is running, you have to
install the apk file on the emulator:

adb install build/masumi-android-debug.apk

adb is in the platform-tools directory of the SDK.

You may find that the executable already exists on the device, so before 
installing it again, you will simply have to uninstall it using the
UI on the emulator (probably there is a way to do this with the adb
tool too, but I haven't tried).

Finally, to run the tests simple do

ant run-tests

Note: masumi-android requires that masumi-core is built and copied
into the masumi-android/libs directory.  To do that simply run

ant compile

from the main Masumi distribution.
